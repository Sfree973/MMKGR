# MMKGR

  This is the pre-release code release of the following paper: MMKGR: Multi-hop Multi-modal Knowledge Graph Reasoning
In the structure of code, we not only share the MMKGR model(UAN+RL) and data processing code, but also compare the transformer and the transformer after combining UAN with the trans_UAN. 
  The purpose of our sharing is to respect the open source regulations of the web conf 2022 and feed back the results to the knowledge graph community.
